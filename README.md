# Holosnap: 3D Model Generation from 2D Images and/or Videos

## Demonstration

- Check out a demo of our 3D depth estimation. [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ly3STceOTAws5W7EJGc7k6AEyFfgvi4U/view?usp=sharing).

## Overview

Holosnap transforms 2D images and videos into 3D models including `.obj`, `.glb`, and `.fbx` file formats utilizing advanced techniques in deep learning and generative AI. Key processes involve generating point clouds, constructing meshes, and extracting features to deliver high-quality detailed 3D models.

## Objectives

- Transform 2D images and videos into 3D models.
- Produce detailed 3D file formats suitable for further refinement by our expert 3D team.
- Utilize deep learning techniques to augment the depth and detail of 3D models if any parts are missing

## Goals
- We aim to produce 3D models from 360-degree view videos or from 10-12 images covering a 360-view, accompanied by generative AI to fill in missing parts of objects.

## Current Status

- Implementation of point cloud generation from a single image
- Advanced object segmentation and depth estimation from videos
- Feature extraction and object recognition algorithms to improve model precision.


## Performance Metrics

- **Processing Time:** It will take approximately 2-9 minutes, depending on the number of images.
- **Model Accuracy:** Accuracy depends on the number of images. More images generally result in higher accuracy.

## Roadmap

- Our team is actively addressing cutting-edge problems, focusing on delivering high-quality solutions for enterprise-level customers. We expect the product to be ready for use within a few months.

## Technologies Employed

- **Deep Learning & Generative AI:** Leveraging cutting-edge AI to enhance 3D model generation.
- **PyTorch:** The preferred framework for AI model development and training.

## Research and Development

- **Research Initiatives:** Staying updated with the latest trends by going through the research papers of top conferences like ICCV and ICLR.
- **Custom Development:** Customizing algorithms from scratch to meet specific needs in 3D reconstruction.

## Future Publications

- Our focus currently lies in product developemnt  in enterprise environments. Publication of our methodologies and contributions to the academic community is planned post-launch.
