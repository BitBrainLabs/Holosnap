# Holosnap: 3D Image Generation from 2D Images and Videos

## Overview

Holosnap is at the forefront of converting 2D images and videos into 3D file formats including `.obj`, `.glb`, and `.fbx`. Utilizing advanced techniques in deep learning and generative AI, our solution transforms 2D data into rich 3D representations. Key processes involve generating point clouds, constructing meshes, and extracting features to deliver high-fidelity 3D models.

## Objectives

- Transform 2D images and videos into 3D models.
- Produce detailed 3D file formats suitable for further refinement by our expert 3D team.
- Utilize AI to augment the depth and detail of 3D models, compensating for incomplete data in the original objects.

## Current Status

- Implementation of point cloud generation from single images, leveraging both traditional and AI-driven techniques.
- Advanced object segmentation and depth estimation from videos to facilitate accurate 3D reconstruction.
- Continuous enhancement of feature extraction and object recognition algorithms to elevate model precision.

## Demonstration

## Performance Metrics

- **Processing Time:** Approximately 2 to 9 minutes per model, varying with the dataset size.
- **Model Accuracy:** Enhanced by the richness of the dataset; multiple images create comprehensive point clouds and more precise models.

## Roadmap

- Ongoing refinement of AI algorithms and processing strategies.
- Anticipated readiness for enterprise deployment within the upcoming quarters.

## Technologies Employed

- **Deep Learning & Generative AI:** Harnessing cutting-edge AI to improve 3D model generation.
- **PyTorch:** The preferred framework for AI model development and training.

## Research and Development

- **Research Initiatives:** Keeping pace with emerging trends through major conferences such as ICCV and ICLR.
- **Custom Development:** Tailoring algorithms from the ground up to meet specialized demands of 3D reconstruction.

## Future Publications

- Our focus currently lies in product enhancement and application in enterprise environments. Publication of our methodologies and contributions to the academic community is planned post-launch.
